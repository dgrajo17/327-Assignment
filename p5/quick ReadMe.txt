def withdraw(self, fromAccNum, amount): - lines 58 - 68 - test with decision coverage
It has two if/else statements so a decision coverage exploring all 4 possible paths would be 
a good test for it

def create(self, accNum, accName) - lines 91-93 - test with statement coverage
It is a one line statement (following an if statement) so not really much testing we could do
other than statement coverage
