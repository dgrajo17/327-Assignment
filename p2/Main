# Note about delete - If you created a new account, you cannot delete it within the same session
# I, personally, thought this was a bug but in the requirements it says 'no transactions on this new account should be accepted this session'
# So, you know what, pretty good, close enough
# But if you wanted to know the reason, it's because login() opens the vaf.txt file and stores it in a variable vaf
# When you do createAccount(), it updates the vaf.txt file with the new account number, BUT the contents of the variable vaf is still the old vaf.txt
# So even though vaf.txt is new, vaf the variable still contains the old account numbers

#because it could be a restriction we have to work in
