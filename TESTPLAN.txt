TEST PLAN:

The team has organized the tests by having a folder for every feature. This will be the simplest and cleanest organization structure,
as it will be easy for the team to stick to the structure and make sure all tests are completed and working.

The tests will be executed as shell scripts. Currently, the input files/input command files use variables names such as accName, accNum etc. 
This is done to avoid having to hard code the test values for every individual case, especially for tests where a large number of tests could
be beneficial. When the tests are actually being conducted, these variables will be replaced by the necessary inputs through the use of an
input stream.

The outputs will be validated through comparison to their expected output files through comparison,
i.e. 
if (output == expectedOutput):
    return true
else:
    return false

The results of these tests will be stored and organized in text files using an output stream, which will then be stored with the original 
test cases to ensure no failed cases get lost or forgotten about, and to allow easier comparison with future test runs.
